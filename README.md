# "Find your DEA" Project ( to find the nearest AED to you in Madrid)

This project has been created as a homework for the Master in Python Programming.

It consist in a simple web page whitch received the user location and it show where is the nearest defibrilator.

This application is working with an API of the community of Madrid. So it basically calculate, from the user location, every hypotenuse till the every defibrillators location and showing the one with minimun distance.
It also show a link to google maps where you can exactly see the way you can reach that AED through.

As an noveltry for me, I'm using an utm module to convert the x and y coordinates to a lat-logn coordinates and vice versa as the API works with the firsts and google maps is using longitude and latitude to show any location.

The user location is captured using a js script.

The whole project is working in a Django framework.

NOTE: There are some links going nowhere as, at first I created the appearance of the website, thinking the proyect would cover more topics.
But it finally didn't happen so that's why some buttoms are doing nothing.

Feel free to ask anything, or keep working on it. 
I can give you all the details you may need.
